== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Wait, where are all the icons? =

Currently, the Icon Block does not include its own library of icons for users to choose from. If that's what you are looking for, my apologies. The there are many other icon blocks out there that have this functionality.

Instead, this plugin allows you to render **any** SVG-based icon by simply copy/pasting the code into the icon textarea! See the screenshots for reference. This give you complete flexibility and allows you to use practically any icon you want. A great source for free SVG icons is Google's Material Icons project.

= Why is my icon not changing color? =

The Icon Block includes controls for the icon's color and background. However, if your SVG icon has hard coded color/fill values, the plugin will respect those instead of any applied custom colors.

= Why is the block not working for certain users? =

WordPress only allows Administrators and Editors to save SVG content. The Icon Block will not work properly for users who are at the Author level or lower.

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
